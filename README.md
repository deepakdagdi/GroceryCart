GroceryCart is a full-stack e-commerce web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, 
Node.js) with integrated Stripe payment gateway. The platform allows customers (users) to browse and purchase grocery 
items, while the seller (admin) can manage products and orders.

This project simulates a real-world online grocery store where:

Admin acts as the Seller, managing inventory and viewing orders.

Registered Users are Customers, who can add items to their cart, checkout securely using Stripe, and view their order
history.
